After that run following command to create cluster:
kind create cluster --config=file_name.yml

To check the list of clusters
kind get clusters

To get Cluster-Info (Cluster Name kind-demo-cluster)
kubectl cluster-info --context kind-demo-cluster

To collect detailed debugging information about your entire Kubernetes cluster â€” including configuration, API objects, and runtime states
kubectl cluster-info dump | more
Save output to a file: kubectl cluster-info dump > cluster_dump.json
Dump info only for a specific namespace: kubectl cluster-info dump --namespace kube-system
Dump to a directory: kubectl cluster-info dump --output-directory=/tmp/cluster-state

To check Number of nodes available in the cluster
kubectl get nodes

To check the list of nodes for a specific cluster if you have multiple cluster setup on same machine
kubectl get nodes --context kind-demo-cluster

To switch perminently to the specific cluster
kubectl config use-context kind-demo-cluster

To Create namespace
kubectl create ns nginx

To create the pod (Here I take nginx as a image to run in pod)
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx

To delete the pod
kubectl delete pod nginx

To create the pod in the specific namespace
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx -n nginx

To get the list of pods from the specific namespace (nginx is the namespace)
kubectl get pods -n nginx

To delete the pod from the namespace
kubectl delete pod nginx -n nginx

To delete the namespace
kubectl delete ns nginx
